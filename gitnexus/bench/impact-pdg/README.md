# `bench/impact-pdg` — PDG-vs-call-graph impact accuracy harness

> **STATUS: LIVE (U7, statement-anchored rework).** This directory holds the
> curated ground-truth fixture corpus **and** the measurement harness
> (`measure.mjs`, `metrics.mjs`, `baselines.json`). Run it with
> `node --import tsx bench/impact-pdg/measure.mjs` (build `dist/` first — see *How
> to run*). The harness drives both `impact` engines over the fixtures — PDG
> **seeded on the criterion's statement line** so it returns the dependence slice
> — prints a stratified P/R/F1 table + a plain-language decision recommendation,
> and gates regressions with `--check`. The measured result: **PDG is exact at
> intra-procedural statement granularity; call-graph is exact at inter-procedural
> symbol granularity; the two answer different questions and neither dominates.**

## What this measures

`impact` has two engines that answer **different questions at different
granularities**:

- `mode: 'callgraph'` (the default) — inter-procedural BFS over symbol→symbol
  edges. It answers *"what other symbols depend on / are called by this one?"* at
  **symbol granularity**, scored against `inter_AIS`.
- `mode: 'pdg'` (opt-in) — a **statement-anchored** intra-procedural dependence
  slice from the persisted CDG + REACHING_DEF Program Dependence Graph. Seeded
  with `line: N` (`impact({mode:'pdg', line:N})`), it returns
  `affectedStatements: {line, filePath, text}[]` — the dependent **statements** of
  the changed line N. It answers *"which statements inside this function does
  changing line N affect?"* at **line granularity**, scored against `intra_AIS`.

They measure **different scopes**, so the harness scores each at its native
granularity against its native ground truth and reports both side by side. The
"which is more accurate?" question gets an honest, per-scope answer rather than a
single blended number — and the answer is *they answer different questions;
neither strictly dominates*.

> **A note on `line`.** A whole-symbol PDG slice (no `line`) is empty by design:
> intra-procedural dependence stays inside the function, so every reachable block
> is already part of the whole-symbol seed. The useful PDG mode is the
> **statement-anchored** one — seed the criterion's changed statement and read
> the dependent statements back. This is the central change the U7 *rework*
> measures; the earlier "PDG is empty / callgraph wins" verdict was an artifact of
> the whole-symbol seed, now replaced.

## The corpus

Each case is a tiny self-contained TypeScript source repo plus a
`ground-truth.json`. TypeScript is used throughout because it has the most
mature CFG/PDG support in this codebase.

`line` is the `criterion.line` — the statement the PDG slice seeds on.

| Case | Locus | line | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| `intra-dataflow-accumulator` | intra | 8 | loop-carried accumulator def→use (downstream) |
| `intra-dataflow-chain` | intra | 7 | straight-line def→use chain (downstream) |
| `intra-dataflow-reassign` | intra | 9 | reaching defs of a use (upstream, RD-reverse) |
| `intra-control-guard` | intra | 7 | guard-clause control dependence (downstream, CDG-forward) |
| `intra-control-branch` | intra | 7 | if/else-if/else arm control dependence (downstream) |
| `intra-control-loop` | intra | 11 | nested loop+if controllers of a stmt (upstream, CDG-reverse) |
| `inter-dispatcher-thin` | inter | 23 | branch router → 3 handlers (intra slice = routing returns, empty intra_AIS) |
| `inter-facade-delegate` | inter | 21 | guarded sequential delegation chain (empty intra_AIS) |
| `inter-pipeline-stages` | inter | 20 | straight pipeline driver → 3 stages (empty intra_AIS) |
| `mixed-validate-then-call` | mixed | 13 | guard-dominated intra dependence + 1 callee |
| `mixed-compute-and-emit` | mixed | 12 | data-flow-dominated intra dependence + 1 callee |
| `mixed-guarded-dispatch` | mixed | 15 | control+data intra dependence + 2 callees |
| `nobody-interface-excluded` | n/a | — | no-body symbols (KTD6); **excluded** from PDG scoring |

**Minimum corpus floor (KTD9/F3):** ≥ 3 cases per locus stratum, ≥ 12 total
measurable cases. Current: intra = 6, inter = 3, mixed = 3 → 12 measurable
(+1 excluded no-body case). Below this floor the U7 harness must print
"underpowered — directional only" instead of a verdict.

## Annotation schema (`ground-truth.json`)

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | int | schema version (currently `1`) |
| `criterion` | `{ name, filePath, direction, line?, marker?, pdgEdgeKinds? }` | the changed symbol — the seed for "what is affected if I change this". `direction` ∈ `downstream` \| `upstream`. **`line`** is the **1-based source line of the statement being changed** — the seed of the statement-anchored PDG slice (`impact({mode:'pdg', line})`). It is chosen from **source semantics** (the def/criterion whose change propagates to the `intra_AIS` lines), *not* by running the traversal (KTD9 annotation-circularity guard), then reconciled against the live traversal in the harness's Step 0. `marker` is a substring unique to the criterion function's body (appears in one of its `BasicBlock.text` fragments); the smoke test uses it to locate the criterion function's blocks deterministically. `pdgEdgeKinds` lists the PDG edge kinds (`REACHING_DEF` \| `CDG`) the criterion function is expected to produce: a pure straight-line data-flow criterion declares only `REACHING_DEF` (no branches → no control dependence), a branching/guard criterion declares both. The smoke test asserts exactly the declared kinds are non-zero on the criterion (so the pure-dataflow archetype isn't forced to carry an artificial branch) and that the criterion produces ≥ 1 PDG edge overall (catching an accidental no-body/zero-edge criterion). `line`, `marker`, and `pdgEdgeKinds` are required for every measurable case; all three are omitted only on `pdgScoring: "exclude"` no-body cases. |
| `intra_AIS` | `AisEntry[]` | symbols/**lines** truly affected WITHIN the same function (the scope where PDG mode is defined). Annotated at **symbol/line granularity, never block-id** (block ids carry fragile `fnLine:fnCol:idx`). |
| `inter_AIS` | `AisEntry[]` | symbols truly affected ACROSS function boundaries (the scope where call-graph mode is defined and intra-procedural PDG is zero-by-design). |
| `locus` | `'intra' \| 'inter' \| 'mixed' \| 'n/a'` | the dominant impact locus; `n/a` only for excluded no-body cases. |
| `pdgScoring` | `'exclude'` (optional) | present (= `"exclude"`) only on no-body cases U7 must drop from PDG denominators. |
| `provenance` | `'manual' \| 'mutation'` | how the AIS was derived. **v1 is `manual` only** — the mutation track (perturb a statement, diff the changed outcomes) needs a fixture-runner + value-diff harness that does not exist yet, so it is deferred. The field stays for forward-compatibility. |
| `analyzerVersion` | string | pinned analyzer version marker (currently the `package.json` version) so ground truth versions against the analyzer. |
| `rationale` | string | prose — WHY each AIS element is in or out. This is what makes manual annotation defensible (SLICEBENCH generate-then-verify discipline). |

`AisEntry` = `{ symbol, filePath, line?, note? }`. `line` is 1-based and present
for intra entries (which are statement-granular); inter entries name a whole
symbol and omit `line`.

`intra_AIS` and `inter_AIS` are **disjoint** for every case (an intra entry is a
line within the criterion function; an inter entry is a different symbol).

## Validity threats (the two that dominate — KTD9)

1. **Ground-truth incompleteness.** A hand-annotated handful of fixtures yields
   *point estimates* over a tiny, self-admittedly incomplete corpus. One
   mis-annotation can swing F1 by a large fraction, so U7 reports findings as a
   **direction**, not a headline decimal, until the corpus grows / the mutation
   track lands.
2. **Annotation circularity.** PDG's `intra_AIS` risks being reconciled against
   the PDG traversal's own output. **Mitigation (KTD9 annotation-circularity
   guard): these annotations are written from SOURCE SEMANTICS first** — reading
   the source and reasoning about def→use / control dependence by hand — and
   reconciling against the live traversal is **U7's job (its Step 0), not the
   annotation's**. Call-graph gets no such home-field annotation, so the
   comparison is not rigged toward PDG.

## Methodology — CIS / AIS, stratified (KTD9, Arnold–Bohner)

For each fixture × mode the harness compares the mode's **CIS** (Computed Impact
Set — what it reports as impacted) against the **AIS** (Actual Impact Set — the
curated ground truth), at the mode's **native granularity**, stratified by impact
locus:

- **precision** = |AIS∩CIS| / |CIS| (over-approximation cost),
- **recall** = |AIS∩CIS| / |AIS| (under-approximation; the *dangerous* miss for
  a safety tool),
- **F1** = harmonic mean,
- **FPIS** = CIS − AIS (noise), **FNIS** = AIS − CIS (missed),
- **|CIS|/|AIS|** size ratio.

**Each engine is scored at its own granularity against its own ground truth:**

- **PDG → line granularity vs `intra_AIS`.** CIS_pdg is the set of
  `affectedStatements` **line** keys (`<filePath>:<line>`) returned by the
  line-seeded slice; AIS is the `intra_AIS` line set. This is the unit at which
  PDG is precise — the dependent *statements* of the changed line.
- **Call-graph → symbol granularity vs `inter_AIS`.** CIS is the reported
  **symbol** keys (`<symbol>@<filePath>`); AIS is the `inter_AIS` symbol set.
  This is the unit at which the cross-function blast radius is meaningful.

**Empty-denominator semantics are explicit, never silently 0/1.** |CIS|=0 ⇒
precision is `n/a` (no predictions); |AIS|=0 ⇒ recall is `n/a` (no truth in that
scope). A scope with an `n/a` metric is **excluded** from that metric's mean,
never folded in as 0 (the apples-to-oranges trap, R1). The pure scorer lives in
`metrics.mjs`; its arithmetic is pinned by the deterministic unit test
`test/unit/impact-pdg-metric-math.test.ts` (synthetic sets only — no analyze, no
DB, so it stays out of the flaky full-pipeline lane).

**Stratification.** Each fixture is scored in its **own** locus stratum
(intra/inter/mixed). Within a stratum, the PDG row is line-vs-`intra_AIS` and the
call-graph row is symbol-vs-`inter_AIS`:

- On an **intra** fixture, `inter_AIS` is empty, so call-graph reports no other
  symbol → its row is `n/a` (no cross-function truth). PDG is scored against the
  real `intra_AIS`.
- On an **inter** fixture, `intra_AIS` is empty by design, so the PDG line slice
  returns only the router's own control-dependent statements — FPIS against the
  empty truth (precision 0, recall `n/a`). Call-graph is scored against the real
  `inter_AIS`. This is the honest *"PDG is intra-procedural; on a pure-inter
  fixture it has no meaningful intra ground truth"* result — **symmetric** to
  call-graph's empty intra row.
- On a **mixed** fixture, both rows are real: PDG resolves the intra statement
  set, call-graph reaches the callee(s).

**PDG cannot cross a function boundary; call-graph cannot see below function
granularity.** Neither is a refinement of the other — they compose. A full
mixed-locus blast radius is the *union* of call-graph's inter-symbol reach and
PDG's intra-statement slice.

## Substrate (the load-bearing mechanism — R8)

`runPipelineFromRepo` is in-memory and never persists, but `impact` queries a
**persisted** `lbugPath` + a `meta.pdg` stamp; there is no exported `runAnalyze`
(the entrypoint `analyzeCommand` calls `process.exit`, unusable in a loop), and
the test-suite `vi.mock` bridge is vitest-only. So the harness runs **real
analyze via a temp `GITNEXUS_HOME`, mock-free**. Per fixture:

1. Point `process.env.GITNEXUS_HOME` at a per-run temp dir (honored by
   `repo-manager.getGlobalDir()` — it roots the registry; the per-repo DB lands
   in `<fixtureCopy>/.gitnexus/`, so fixtures are copied to a temp working dir
   first, keeping the source tree clean).
2. **Shell out** to the real CLI as a child process — child-process isolation
   sidesteps `process.exit`; real `saveMeta` + `registerRepo` land in the temp
   home; parse workers spawn from `dist/` (so the harness needs a built `dist/`):

   ```
   node --import tsx src/cli/index.ts analyze <fixtureCopy> --pdg --skip-git --index-only
   ```
3. `new LocalBackend(); await init()` resolves the fixture via the **real**
   registry (the parent process sets `GITNEXUS_HOME` too, so `init()` reads the
   temp registry, not `~/.gitnexus`).
4. `callTool('impact', …)` ×2 (the absolute path is a tier-1 path match — no
   name collision): once `mode:'callgraph'` (symbol BFS), once `mode:'pdg'` with
   `line: criterion.line` so it returns the **statement-anchored slice**
   (`affectedStatements`). A whole-symbol PDG slice (no `line`) is empty by
   design, so the seed line is load-bearing.
5. Teardown the temp home + copy.

### Step 0 — fixture AIS validation (gated on the live traversal; circularity)

Before scoring, the harness reconciles each fixture against the live analyzer
(`metrics.mjs` is annotation-only; Step 0 is the *traversal* reconciliation):

- the criterion must produce **≥ 1 PDG edge** (an accidental no-body / cap-
  truncated criterion has unmeasurable ground truth → excluded, logged);
- the criterion symbol must **not** share `(filePath, startLine)` with another
  `Function`/`Method` (one count query) — same-line projection ambiguity (R4)
  would reconcile AIS against the wrong symbol's edges → excluded, logged.

Per the **annotation-circularity guard**, this reconciliation runs *second*: the
`criterion.line` and the AIS were written from source semantics *first* (read the
source, find the def/criterion whose change propagates), and Step 0 only confirms
the fixture is measurable substrate — it never *derives* ground truth from the
traversal. Where a source-derived belief disagreed with the live block-granular
traversal, the **annotation** was corrected (documented in each
`ground-truth.json` rationale), not the metric re-fit:

- **Direction.** `inter-pipeline-stages`'s AIS named callees while the criterion
  was tagged `upstream`; the annotation was corrected to `downstream`.
- **Block coalescing.** The CFG coalesces consecutive straight-line statements
  into one `BasicBlock`. `intra-dataflow-chain` (8,9 → inside the line-7 seed
  block), `intra-control-guard` (12 → inside the line-11 block), and
  `intra-dataflow-reassign` (8 → inside the line-7 block) had `intra_AIS` lines
  that can never surface as *distinct* statements; those were removed.
- **Under-counted dependencies.** The combined CDG+REACHING_DEF slice reaches more
  than a control-only or single-step reading: `intra-control-branch` (+line 10,
  the nested `else if` predicate, control-dependent on the outer branch),
  `intra-control-loop` (+lines 6,7, the param block and `count` init reaching the
  increment), and `intra-dataflow-reassign` (+line 6, the param def of `a`) gained
  lines the original annotation missed.

After reconciliation, the line-seeded slice reproduces each corrected `intra_AIS`
exactly (FPIS = FNIS = 0 on all 6 intra and all 3 mixed fixtures). Call-graph gets
no such home-field annotation, so the comparison is not rigged toward PDG.

## Measured results (analyzer 1.6.7, 12 measurable + 1 excluded)

Each engine scored at its **native granularity** against its **native ground
truth** — PDG at line vs `intra_AIS`, call-graph at symbol vs `inter_AIS`:

| Scope | Mode | Granularity | P | R | F1 | \|CIS\|/\|AIS\| | FPIS | FNIS | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| intra | callgraph | symbol/inter | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| intra | **pdg** | **line/intra** | **1.000** | **1.000** | **1.000** | 1.000 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| inter | **callgraph** | **symbol/inter** | **1.000** | **1.000** | **1.000** | 1.000 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| inter | pdg | line/intra | 0.000 | n/a | n/a | n/a | 10 | 0 | 3 |
| mixed | **callgraph** | **symbol/inter** | **1.000** | **1.000** | **1.000** | 1.000 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| mixed | **pdg** | **line/intra** | **1.000** | **1.000** | **1.000** | 1.000 | 0 | 0 | 3 |

Read it honestly:

- **PDG mode is exact at intra-procedural statement granularity.** On all 6 intra
  fixtures and all 3 mixed fixtures, the line-seeded slice returns *exactly* the
  reconciled `intra_AIS` — F1 = 1.000, FPIS = FNIS = 0. It precisely identifies
  the dependent statements of the changed line (def→use chains, control-dependent
  arms, reaching defs). This is the question PDG was built to answer, and the
  earlier "empty / no signal" result was purely the whole-symbol-seed artifact.
- **Call-graph mode is exact on the cross-function questions.** On all 3 inter
  fixtures and all 3 mixed fixtures it recovers every callee — F1 = 1.000. It is
  the engine for "what else calls/uses this?".
- **The two `n/a` / `0` cells are by design, not defects.** *intra/call-graph*: a
  self-contained function calls no other symbol, so call-graph reports nothing and
  `inter_AIS` is empty → no cross-function truth to score (`n/a`). *inter/pdg*: a
  pure-inter router has an empty `intra_AIS`, and the line-seeded slice returns the
  router's *own* control-dependent routing returns — FPIS against the empty truth
  (precision 0, recall `n/a`). These are **symmetric**: each engine is blind to
  the other's scope. PDG cannot cross a call boundary; call-graph cannot see below
  a function. The per-case lines surface each slice (`pdg line/intra: …`) and each
  callee set (`cg symbol/inter: …`) so this is visible, not hidden.

## Decision recommendation (the verdict — F2)

> **The two engines answer different questions at different granularities, and
> neither dominates.**
>
> - **`mode:'callgraph'` (the default)** is the correct engine for the
>   *inter-procedural* safety question — *"what else depends on / calls this

>   1.0 on this corpus) and carries the cross-function reach the blast radius
>   needs. Use it for cross-symbol impact.
> - **`mode:'pdg'` (opt-in, seeded with `line:N`, where `analyze --pdg` persisted
>   the layer)** is **precise at intra-procedural *statement* granularity** —
>   *"which statements inside this function does changing line N affect?"* On the
>   intra and mixed fixtures it reproduces the dependent-statement set exactly
>   (intra & mixed PDG F1 = 1.0, FPIS = FNIS = 0). This is a question call-graph

## Validity threats (the two that dominate — KTD9)

1. **Ground-truth incompleteness.** A hand-annotated handful of fixtures yields
   *point estimates* over a tiny, self-admittedly incomplete corpus. One
   mis-annotation can swing F1 by a large fraction, so the harness reports
   findings as a **direction**, not a headline decimal, and prints an explicit
   "underpowered — directional only" banner when the corpus falls below the
   floor.
2. **Annotation circularity.** PDG's `intra_AIS` risks being reconciled against
   the PDG traversal's own output. **Mitigation:** these annotations are written
   from SOURCE SEMANTICS first (U6) — reading the source and reasoning about
   def→use / control dependence by hand — and reconciling against the live
   traversal is the harness's **Step 0**, run *second*, only to confirm
   measurability. Call-graph gets no such home-field annotation, so the
   comparison is not rigged toward PDG.

## Underpowered-corpus rule (F3)

**Minimum corpus floor: ≥ 3 measurable cases per locus stratum, ≥ 12 total.**
Current corpus is exactly at the floor (intra 6, inter 3, mixed 3 = 12
measurable; +1 excluded no-body) — so the harness prints headline decimals. When
the measurable count after exclusions drops below the floor, it instead prints
**"underpowered — directional only"** and reports the DIRECTION ("PDG exact at
intra statement granularity; call-graph exact at inter symbol granularity")
rather than headline decimals — decimal precision (`F1 0.74 vs 0.68`) implies a
confidence a sub-floor corpus cannot support. Even at the floor the F1 = 1.0
results should be read as *"exact on this small, deliberately-simple corpus"*, not
*"exact in general"* — see the validity threats.

## Annotation fingerprint + `--check` (two gates, KTD10)

`--check` runs **two non-byte-identity gates** (an exact-equality gate would go
perpetually red on legitimate accuracy changes):

1. **One-sided F1 regression band** per mode per scope: fail iff `F1 < band − ε`;
   improvements pass freely. `ε` and the per-`(scope,mode)` bands are versioned
   in `baselines.json`. The four live bands are **intra/pdg = 1.0**, **mixed/pdg =
   1.0**, **inter/callgraph = 1.0**, **mixed/callgraph = 1.0**. A `null` band
   means F1 is genuinely undefined for that cell on this corpus (intra/callgraph
   and inter/pdg — see *Measured results*) — the gate skips it.
2. **Order-independent annotation fingerprint** over the curated ground-truth
   set (a SHA-256 over a sorted, line-collapsed canonicalization — mirrors the
   `bench/cfg/measure.mjs` *technique*, written here, not a literal import). Any
   unreviewed edit to a `ground-truth.json` (criterion **including
   `criterion.line`**, AIS membership, locus, direction, edge kinds) trips it; a
   pure reordering of AIS entries does not.

**Substrate stability (F5).** Real analyze is the repo's flaky lane, so `--check`
applies **median-of-K** across `GN_IMPACT_PDG_K` runs *before* comparing F1 to
the band, so substrate noise can't trip the metric gate. Default K = 1 (the
fixtures are tiny and deterministic in practice); raise it
(`GN_IMPACT_PDG_K=3`) in a flaky CI lane.

## Runtime budget

Each fixture costs **one full `analyze --pdg` child process** (a fresh tree-sitter
parse + CFG/PDG build + persist) plus two in-process `impact` calls (one
call-graph, one line-seeded PDG). On these tiny fixtures that is ≈
**3–6 s/fixture**, so the full 13-fixture corpus runs in roughly **45–80 s**
wall-clock single-threaded (K = 1). A K-fold `--check` multiplies by K. For a
fast substrate smoke, scope to a subset:
`--only=intra-dataflow-chain,inter-dispatcher-thin,mixed-guarded-dispatch` (or
`GN_IMPACT_PDG_ONLY=…`). Not wired into `npm test` (matches the other benches);
the deterministic metric-math unit test *is* in `npm test`.

## How to run

```sh
cd gitnexus
node scripts/build.js                                          # REQUIRED: workers spawn from dist/
node --import tsx bench/impact-pdg/measure.mjs                 # print the stratified report + verdict
node --import tsx bench/impact-pdg/measure.mjs --json          # machine report (for re-baselining)
node --import tsx bench/impact-pdg/measure.mjs --check          # gate against baselines.json (exit non-zero on regression)
node --import tsx bench/impact-pdg/measure.mjs --only=a,b,c     # fast subset (substrate smoke)
```

### Re-baseline (after a reviewed accuracy or ground-truth change)

1. `node --import tsx bench/impact-pdg/measure.mjs --json` and read
   `annotationFingerprint` + `strata[scope][mode].f1`.
2. Copy those into `baselines.json` (`annotationFingerprint`, the `f1Bands`
   cells), bump `analyzerVersion` if the analyzer moved, adjust `epsilon` only
   deliberately.
3. Confirm `--check` is green.

The fixtures are also validated by the integration test
`test/integration/impact-pdg-fixtures.test.ts` (schema well-formedness + a smoke
test that each fixture analyzes under `--pdg` and the criterion function produces
its declared CDG / REACHING_DEF edges — a zero-edge criterion has unmeasurable
ground truth).
